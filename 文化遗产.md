前言 

中国传统门神画不仅是民间艺术的象征，也是中国绘画历史中的重要组成部分。其艺术特征融入了丰富的象征主义、民间信仰及装饰性艺术元素，表现出浓厚的文化符号学价值。门神画的形式与色彩，尤其是在构图和视觉冲击力上，长期以来都受到学者和艺术家的高度评价。在数字修复的背景下，运用AI技术进行门神画的修复，不仅是对其视觉层面的复原，更是对其文化内涵与艺术价值的再造。通过深度学习和图像识别，AI能够精确分析画作的细节，重建破损部分，确保艺术风格与历史背景的精确再现。这种结合“形式主义”与“符号学”理论的修复方式，为传统艺术带来了新的生机，推动了数字时代艺术创作的跨界融合。此外，AI技术为门神画带来了更加现代化的诠释方式，为传统艺术的当代传承和文化遗产保护提供了创新的路径。
Introduction
The traditional Chinese Door God paintings are not only symbols of folk art but also an important part of Chinese painting history. Their artistic characteristics integrate rich elements of symbolism, folk beliefs, and decorative art, reflecting profound semiotic value. The form and color of Door God paintings, especially in terms of composition and visual impact, have long been highly regarded by scholars and artists. In the context of digital restoration, using AI technology for restoration is not only about restoring their visual aspects but also recreating their cultural connotations and artistic value. Through deep learning and image recognition, AI can accurately analyze the details of the painting, reconstruct damaged sections, and ensure the precise recreation of the artistic style and historical context. This restoration approach, combining "formalism" and "semiotics" theory, brings new vitality to traditional art and promotes the interdisciplinary fusion of art creation in the digital age. Moreover, AI provides a more modern interpretation of Door God paintings, offering innovative pathways for the contemporary inheritance of traditional art and cultural heritage preservation.


门神介绍
Menshen, or door gods,[1] are divine guardians of doors and gates in Chinese folk religions, used to protect against evil influences or to encourage the entrance of positive ones. They began as the divine pair Shenshu (Chinese: 神荼; Jyutping: San4syu1; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Sîn-su) and Yulü(Chinese: 鬱壘; Jyutping: Wat1leot6; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Ut-lu̍t) under the Han, but the deified generals Qin Shubao (Chinese: 秦叔寶; Jyutping: Ceon4Suk1bou2; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Chîn Siok-pó) and Yuchi Gong (Chinese: 尉遲恭; Jyutping: Wat1ci4 Gung1; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Ut-tî Kiong) have been more popular since the Tang. In cases where a door god is affixed to a single door, Wei Zheng or Zhong Kui is commonly used.

历史
Since the Shang and Zhou Dynasties, the tradition of worshipping Door Gods has existed in ancient China. In the Han Dynasty, Wang Chong’s *Lunheng* mentioned that door, gate, well, stove, and central hall were all worshipped for their protective functions. Early depictions of Door Gods, such as the Vermilion Bird and guards with weapons, have been found on tomb doors in Nanyang, Henan. The practice of Door God paintings became more popular with the rise of woodblock printing techniques. From the Five Dynasties to the Northern Song, mass production of Door Gods spread their images widely, evolving into diverse forms and becoming a unique art form with distinct aesthetic value.

Shentu and Yulei are classic figures in Door God paintings. Ancient texts mention, "Paint Shentu and Yulei with tigers on the door to ward off evil spirits." *Jingchu Suishi Ji* further describes their images: "On New Year's Day, two gods in armor holding halberds are painted on both sides of the door; Shentu is on the left, Yulei on the right, commonly known as Door Gods." The Door God painting *Shentu·Yulei* housed in the National Library of China shows Shentu with a kind face and Yulei with a fierce expression. Both are dressed in armor, holding golden hammers, embodying the "big head, small body" style of traditional Door Gods. The use of complementary colors in their armor enhances the visual impact. Other common Door Gods include Zhong Kui, the god who expels evil, the clever celestial child, and the deities of wealth, prosperity, and longevity, all emphasizing both their divine qualities and human emotions.

After the Tang Dynasty, Door God images began to feature historical figures. Among many scholars and military generals, Qin Qiong and Wei Chigong became classic subjects for Door God paintings, especially after the Yuan Dynasty. These Door Gods, though varied in attire and expression, maintain a consistent style with dignified and exaggerated figures. For example, the Hunan Tantou Door God Painting depicts Qin Qiong and Wei Chigong with their attendants, with Qin Qiong wielding a staff and Wei Chigong holding a whip. The painting is simple yet strong, maintaining traditional proportions to create a sense of stability and fullness. Common civil Door Gods include figures like Xiao He, Bao Zheng, and Wen Tianxiang, often portrayed with detailed official attire to emphasize their integrity, strictness, and resistance to corruption, while also highlighting the painting’s texture.

During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the development of Door God paintings was closely tied to advancements in printing technology and the popularity of Yuan Dynasty drama and Ming-Qing novels. The subjects were diverse, covering mythology, history, opera stories, folk customs, and auspicious animals, reflecting the social demands and widespread recognition of this art form.

In the 1930s and 1940s, Door Gods began to feature heroic figures from the War of Resistance. Artists from the Yan'an "Lu Yi Woodcut Work Team," such as Hu Yichuan, Yan Han, Luo Gongliu, and Hua Shan, used woodcut prints to support the war and boost national spirit. For example, Yan Han’s *Military-Civilian Cooperation, Victory in the War* adopts the traditional Door God style, depicting two brave soldiers on horseback, symbolizing the belief in victory and the inspiring power of the resistance.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Door Gods in New Year paintings took on new forms, reflecting the combination of artistic care and social reality. For example, in the 1960s and 1970s, Jiangsu Taohua Wu Door God paintings depicted hardworking farmers, pioneering workers, youth devoted to construction, and border soldiers. These new "Door Gods" represented people's hopes for agricultural abundance, industrial growth, technological progress, and national stability. Common images in the paintings, such as cotton, rice, wheat, corn, and achievements like steel mills, dams, bridges, and power towers, symbolized the era's development.
